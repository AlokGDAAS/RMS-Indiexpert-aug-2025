AuthSystem

This is user authentication part of my paroject Reataurent management system

It provides basic functionality for secure 

sign up, 
log in, 
sign out, 
update username, and change password, with hashed passwords and activity logging.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features


User Sign Up

  - Supports registering new users.
  - First user must be an admin.
  - Only Admins can add new staff users by sign in method.
  - Admins can add new admin users also by sign in method.

Secure Passwords
  - Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` before saving .
  - Plaintext passwords are never stored.

User Log In & Log Out
  - Authenticates using username and password.
  - Verifies hashed passwords.

Update User Info
  - Admin and staff can Change their username password.
  - Change password with confirmation.
  - Logs all changes.

Activity Logging
  - All logins, signups, signouts, and changes are logged with timestamps.
  - Logs are saved to a file for auditing.


Data Persistence

  - User data is stored in JSON files.
  - Easy to read and modify for debugging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `bcrypt` module (install with `pip install bcrypt`)

Note: `msvcrt` is used for password masking and works only on Windows.
